# Set up Custom Actions in Sourcetree

As we work primarily with Flare `htm` files, it is useful to be able to quickly open files individual files from Sourcetree in your favorite text editor.

??? Recommendation
I recommend that you use Visual Studio Code. A great text editor!

## Custom actions

One way to leverage custom actions is to set it up to use external applications, like VS Code, so you can quickly open individual topics. If you clikc on an `htm` file, it opens in Notepad, which is not useful. We can set a custom action to open these files in our preferred editor.

To set up a custom action, do the following:

1. Select **Tools** from the menu bar.
1. Select **Options**.
1. Click the **Custom Actions** tab.
1. Click **Add**.
1. Enter the **Menu Caption**: The name of the action.
1. Enter the path to the program.
1. Enter the parameter that is passed to the executable.

1. Click **OK**.
1. Right click on a file.
1. Select **Custom Actions**.

    The new action will appear in the options.
