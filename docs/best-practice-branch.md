# Branching Best Practices

To avoid conflicts with local and remote branches, and to keep things consistent, here are some best practices.

1. Fetch/pull often and anytime.

1. Always `pull` before you create a branch.

    This ensures that your branch has all local and remote changes before you branch.
1. Name feature branches:

    `feature/hlp-1`

    `feature/ps-250`

1. After you merge a branch, delete the branch.

1. Name release branches:

    `release/sense-jun-2018`

    `release/nprinting-sep-2020`

1. **NEVER** delete shared branches.

    `master`

    `daily`

    `release/x`
